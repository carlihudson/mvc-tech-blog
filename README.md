  ## Description
    Week 14's assignment was to build a CMS-style blog completely from scratch, following the Model-View-Controller paradigm. Users must be able to log in and out, create, edit, and delete posts, as well as comment on others' posts. This project was done primarily with sequelize, express, and handlebars.js.
